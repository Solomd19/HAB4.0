# HAB4.0
High Altitude Weather Balloon (HAB) 4.0

The HAB project is an annual project run by WPI students, where each year they make a payload to be flown attached to a helium balloon and monitor the data collected from it in real time. I worked on the payload code, working to interface with an array of sensors using an Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

Main features of the payload code include:
1. Autonomous flight termination (programmable flight boundary)
2. Transmitting sensor data during flight via radio in real time
3. Neat organization of sensor data into Excel compatible files

The sensors onboard include:
1. GPS
2. Pressure/altitude sensor
3. Temperature sensor
4. Carbon Dioxide Sensor
5. Methane Sensor
6. Ozone Sensor
7. UV Sensor
